# Random Name Picker
## How to use
Fill in names in the textarea, one line per ticket. When ready, click `Start`.

Whenever the button is clicked, it will randomly loop through the names in the list
and pick one of them as winner. You can run it as many times as you want.

Just replace background.jpg with something of your own, if you want.
